# Stats220 

# This is my repo for STATS 220. 

## Little about me:

1. I am undertaking a degree in **bioloigcal science** in hopes of either
   - *continuing in my postgraduates degree*
   - or becoming a researcher. 

3. I am taking STATS 220 because this is one of the required courses that i was told i needed to take from the student advisors. 

4. im currently taking stats 201 and I think this taking this class as well as stats 201 would be able to properly expand my knowelegde in R programming as well as statatisics over all. I am intrested in making sure i have a good understaning in statistics as well as using these tools in my day to day life and also throughout my degree.
