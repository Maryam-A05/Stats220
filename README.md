# Stats220 

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

I am undertaking a degree in bioloigcal science in hopes of either continuing in my postgraduates degree or becoming a researcher. 

I am taking STATS 220 because this is one of the required courses that i was told i needed to take from the student advisors. 

im currently taking stats 201 and I think this taking this class as well as stats 201 would be able to properly expand my knowelegde in R programming as well as statatisics over all. I am intrested in making sure i have a good understaning in statistics as well as using these tools in my day to day life and also throughout my degree.
